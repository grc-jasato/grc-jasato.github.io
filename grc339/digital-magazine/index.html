                                I think women are praised for always being nice and kind and helpful. And that's something that I've had to sort of outgrow as I grew up as a young woman in the world—that notion of being sweet is the end-all. That sort of mindset got me into a lot of situations where I just didn't stick up for myself. I didn't advocate for myself or treat myself well. There's a lot more adjectives to me than sweet.

                            We don’t need men to survive or be valid functioning members of society. Women are representing themselves in a new grown-up demographic that’s probably quite threatening to what we’ve always known.</p>
