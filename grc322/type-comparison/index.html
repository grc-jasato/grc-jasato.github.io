                        <p>Adobe Garamond, designed by Robert Slimbach in 1989, is a simplistic serif typeface that is considered to be in the roman font family. Its name roots from the French type designer and engraver Claude Garamond. Slimbach designed this typeface as a reaction to his inspiration of Robert Granjon’s italic Garamond assistant. Adobe Garamond is a highly legible typeface that reads well on print and web pages. It was later released as a Pro typeface with the OpenType feature, which can be used digitally in Adobe InDesign. It has six font options including regular, italic, semibold, semibold italic, bold, and bold italic. Its versatility and timelessness allow it to be used for anything ranging from simple articles to professional logos.

                        <p>Minion Pro, originally also designed by Robert Slimbach in 1990, is a classical, oldstyle typeface that evokes the late Renaissance Era, a period of elegant and highly readable type designs. The Cyrillic additions were released in 1992, and the final OpenType Pro version released in 2000. The Minion Pro family has three weights and two widths, supporting many Western languages including Greek and Cyrillic. It has a handful of ligatures, small caps, oldstyle figures, swashes, and other glyphs, which makes it ideal for using in limited-edition books, newsletters, or packaging. Like Adobe Garamond Minion is highly versatile across many platforms and has excellent readability.

                                The bars on the lower case f’s rest at different heights, with Minion’s being higher on the stem. All other elements are similar except for the way the ascenders curve, since Adobe Garamond’s is rounder while Minion’s is sharper.

                                The uppercase W’s are very different, as Adobe Garamond’s looks as if two V’s are overlapping each other, while Minion’s is fully connected in the center. The serifs on Minion’s W are also thicker than Adobe Garamond’s serifs.

                                Adobe Garamond’s cap height for the uppercase J is slightly higher than Minion’s, and its hook is more curved than Minion’s hook. Minion’s descender is also straight and isn’t as thick as Adobe Garamond’s.

                                The 5’s are very different, as Adobe Garamond’s is more slanted upwards to the right and Minion’s is horizontal. Adobe Garamond’s terminal is thinner and longer, and the space between the counter and the top is smaller than that same space in Minion’s 5.

                                The 6’s follow the same style as the upper case P’s, since Adobe Garamond’s doesn’t connect to the main stem while Minion’s does. Adobe Garamond’s 6 also has a taller height.

                                The 9’s follow the same principle as the 6’s, as Adobe Garamond’s counter is not closed while Minion’s is. Adobe Garamond’s 9 also has a taller height and is thinner towards the bottom.
